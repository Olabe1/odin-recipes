        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These fluffy pancakes are soft on the inside and lightly golden on the outside. They are quick to make using simple ingredients you probably already have at home. 
            Perfect for breakfast or brunch, these pancakes rise nicely on the pan and taste great with syrup, fruit, or a little butter.
