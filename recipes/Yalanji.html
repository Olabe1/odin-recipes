        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Yalanji is a traditional Middle Eastern dish made from grape leaves filled with a fragrant mixture of rice, herbs, and spices. 
            These vegetarian stuffed grape leaves are gently rolled by hand and slowly cooked until tender. 
            They have a fresh, tangy flavor from lemon juice and olive oil, with a soft texture that melts in your mouth. 
            Yalanji is often served cold or at room temperature and is a popular dish for family gatherings, holidays, and special occasions.
