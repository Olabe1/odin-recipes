        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Yalanji is a traditional Middle Eastern dish made from grape leaves filled with a fragrant mixture of rice, herbs, and spices. 
            These vegetarian stuffed grape leaves are gently rolled by hand and slowly cooked until tender. 
            They have a fresh, tangy flavor from lemon juice and olive oil, with a soft texture that melts in your mouth. 
            Yalanji is often served cold or at room temperature and is a popular dish for family gatherings, holidays, and special occasions.

        </ul>

        <h3>Cooking Liquid for the Grape Leaves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups Water boiling</li>
            <li>1 Bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1 lemon’s juice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp Tomato paste</li>

            <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 Cardamom pods</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse the vegetables (except the tomatoes) in a food processor until finely chopped. Add tomatoes and pulse briefly a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Combine the chopped vegetables with the soaked rice. Season with salt, pepper, allspice, dried mint, tomato paste, lemon juice, olive oil, and pomegranate molasses. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Let the filling sit for a few minutes so the flavors blend. You can also prepare it ahead and refrigerate it.</li>
            <li>Prepare the grape leaves: rinse jarred leaves well and remove any tough stems. If using fresh leaves, blanch them in hot water until softened.</li>
            <li>Place one leaf on a flat surface with the veiny side facing up. Add a small line of filling near the bottom of the leaf.</li>
            <li>Fold the bottom over the filling, fold in the sides, then roll into a tight cylinder. Keep it snug but not so tight that the rice can’t expand.</li>
            <li>Line the bottom of a pot with extra leaves (and optionally tomato or potato slices). Arrange the rolls tightly in layers so they don’t open while cooking.</li>
            <li>Mix the cooking liquid ingredients, then pour it over the rolls until they are just covered. Place a small plate on top to keep everything in place.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot to a gentle boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the leaves are tender and the rice is cooked.</li>
            <li>Let the pot cool slightly, then serve with lemon wedges. Yogurt on the side is a common option.</li>
        </ol>
